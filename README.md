# Talking Ghosties

I wanted a simple way to have some ghosts appear to be talking that I can project in the front yard for halloween.

This program requires you put an MP3 called `soundtrack.mp3` in the resources folder. It'll play that on loop.

Each ghost's mouth opens according to the volume of the corresponding channel of audio in the MP3. So be sure to give it stereo audio.
